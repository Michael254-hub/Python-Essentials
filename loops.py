# Loops - Repeating Tasks Like a Pro! 🔁

# Loops help us repeat tasks without writing the same code over and over. Think of it like pressing the repeat button on your favorite song 🎵.

# For Loop: Used for repeating tasks over a range.

# Repeats a block of code a fixed number of times.

# 📝 Example:

# Print numbers 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Outputs:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

# While Loop: Runs as long as a condition is True.

# Repeats as long as a condition is true.

# 📝 Example:

countdown = 5

while countdown > 0:
    print("Counting down:", countdown)
    countdown -= 1

print("Blast off! 🚀")



# 💡 You can use loops for all sorts of repetitive tasks—like counting or printing patterns.

# Python makes life easier when you need to repeat things!
